Factory Method Design Pattern

Define an interface for Creating an object, but let subclasses decide which object to 
instantiate. factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses

a method which is a factory
//virtual constructor

Implementation 
*Provide an interface Creating an object-
Here ,do not consider the word interface as java interface.it simply means to provide a contract/method
to create an object

*Let the subclass decide what exact object to instantiate - this pattern involves "Inheritance".


//Requirements 
to provide a batch processor that process fixed length records
