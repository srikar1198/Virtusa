Singleton definition : Ensure that a class has one Instance and provide a global point of
access

Implementation 

1. Make sure that there is only one Instance(Restrict Construction)
make constructor private and let the class manage its instance.

2.provide a global point of access : A static method to get the Sole instance.


Why IT's Hard TO nail down the singleton?

because we can violate the sole instance in java

Serialization/ de serialization
clone 
multi-threaded access
multiple class loaders
garbage collection  //older versions
